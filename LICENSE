This work was created as a means of learning and diffusion for study purposes, so I hope for its free dissemination and dissemination.

While producing it, I mainly observed a two-pronged approach:
- Maintaining the accuracy of definitions, formulas, and descriptions.
- Describe everything with proprietary wording that does not infringe upon the intellectual property of the sources I have drawn on.

For obvious reasons however, mathematical definitions are free up to a point, so where in good faith I have traced the work of licensed material I am happy to take action to remove it. 
You can contact me at the email _____________

Still moving from the initial desire to disseminate knowledge in a streamlined and unconstrained manner.

This work was originally released by the author as a freely downloadable pdf.
